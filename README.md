# AI Snippet Frontend

A frontend application for “AI Snippet” — a React + Vite based UI that allows you to interactively explore, generate, and manage AI-powered code snippets (or content snippets).  

## 🚀 What is this project  
- A modern and minimal frontend built with React + Vite, designed to work with an AI-powered backend (or API) for generating and managing code / content snippets.  
- Provides an intuitive UI for users to generate, view, and manage snippets — making AI-powered snippet generation accessible through a clean web interface.  
- Built to be simple, fast, and developer-friendly; ideal as a boilerplate or base for further customization.  

## ✨ Why this project is useful  
- Lets you quickly prototype and test AI-driven snippet generation workflows.  
- Serves as a clean, minimal template combining React + Vite, useful for learning or building from scratch.  
- Useful for developers who want a ready-to-run UI to integrate with an AI backend — instead of building a UI from scratch every time.  

## 📦 Tech stack & dependencies  
- React (functional components, hooks)  
- Vite as build tool / bundler  
- JavaScript, CSS for styling  
- ESLint + configuration for linting / code quality  
- Standard modern web environment (node, npm/yarn)
